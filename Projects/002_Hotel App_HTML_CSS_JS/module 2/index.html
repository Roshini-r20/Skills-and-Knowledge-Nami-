                <p>
                    Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish and the first thing people think of when they think of Japanese cuisine. For sushi connoisseurs, it’s more than just food. It’s an art form.
                    Sushi refers to a family of artfully presented dishes made with vinegared sushi rice and a variety of ingredients, mostly raw fish and other types of seafood. It can be made with any type of fresh raw fish, some of the most popular being maguro (tuna), 
                    shake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), and unagi (freshwater eel).

                <h2>Sashimi</h2>
                <p>
                    Sashimi refers to thinly sliced raw fish or seafood. It can even refer to different types of raw meat. It’s basically sushi minus the vinegared rice. Like sushi, it’s usually eaten with soy sauce mixed with wasabi.
                    It isn’t fish but pictured below is one of my favorite types of sashimi – uni or sea urchin sashimi. Often served in its own shell, I had this golden glistening bowl at Kuromon Ichiba Market in Osaka but you can pretty much find uni sushi and sashimi at any 
                    seafood market in Japan.

                <h2>Ramen</h2>
                <p>
                    Like sushi, ramen is a Japanese food favorite and one of the best dishes you can eat in Japan. It refers to a noodle soup made with four basic components – the broth, tare (seasoning), wheat noodles, and toppings.
                    Tare (or kaeshi) is the salty concentrated essence placed at the bottom of every ramen bowl. Together with the broth, it’s what determines the style of the ramen, of which there are four main types – shoyu, miso, shio, and tonkotsu. The noodles and toppings 
                    enhance the experience but the true star of this beloved Japanese dish is the seasoned broth.
