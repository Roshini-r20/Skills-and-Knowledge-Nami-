Topics Learnt:

1. 001_Introduction to Git and Github<br>

a. Introduction to Version Control
Introduced to the concept of version control. Next, introduced to Git and how you can leverage that platform to improve your coding abilities. install it and start using it to create and clone code repositories. get more familiar with the different tools and commands it has to offer.

Using Git Locally
 advanced Git interactions by skipping the staging area for small code changes, understanding how Git uses the HEAD alias to represent checked-out snapshots. Next, you’ll explore how to move and remove files before finally getting a cheat sheet to help you in your Git explorations! The next step of your learning will include how to undo changes before committing and how to amend commits once they’re submitted. Finally, you’ll be able to identify errors in commits that were submitted a while back. In the final section of this module, you’ll explore the concept of branching and merging. You’ll learn what a branch is, how to create one, and how they work in harmony with you and your code. Once you’re comfortable with branching, you’ll dive into merging, how it works with branched data, and how to deal with merge conflicts.

Working with Remotes
In this module, you’ll be introduced to GitHub and learn how it works with Git. You’ll create new repositories and clone those repositories onto your computer. Next, we’ll explain what a remote repository is, how we can work with them, and how we can host them. You’ll get familiar with commands like modify, stage, and commit, which will be used for local changes, as well as the fetch command, which can pull any changes from remote repositories. Our final lesson will focus on learning about conflicts. This will allow you to explore the concepts of pull-merge-push workflows, pushing remote branches and rebasing your changes.

Collaboration
collaboration tools available in Git:  overview of pull requests and how the typical workflow of a pull request looks like on GitHub. Next, you’ll dive into how you can squash changes in your code. fork and pull requests. Next up, we’ll cover what code reviews are and what the code review workflow looks like. Then, you’ll learn about how to use code reviews on GitHub. The final lesson of this module will focus on managing projects. We’ll take a rundown of best practices on managing projects and how to manage collaboration within those projects. We’ll explore different ways of tracking issues and finish up by discussing the concept of continuous integration with your projects.
