    <title>Asynchronous Programming</title>

    <pre>
        Some of the techniques are:
        1. Callbacks: passed as an argument to another function. Callbacks make sure that a certain function does not execute until another function has already finished execution.
        2. Promises: A Promise is a holder for a result (or an error) that will become available in the future.
        3. Async/Await: "async/await" was introduced to implement asynchronous code with promises that resemble synchronous code.

        //pass any url that you wish to access to fetch()    
        let response = await fetch(url);
        if (response.ok) { // if HTTP-status is 200-299
            // get the response body 
            let json = await response.json();
            console.log(json)
        }
        else {
            console.log("HTTP-Error: " + response.status);
        }
